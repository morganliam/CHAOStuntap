Requirements for the current code to run:

First we update the packages on the board, with internet from ethernet preferably:

apt-get update
apt-get upgrade

ffmpeg needs to be compiled for arm, the linaro distro used by ADI does not have a pre-built ffmpeg library to use.

ffmpeg static build can be found here:
https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/

The PicoZed SDR uses an ARM cortex-a9 which is a 32 bit ARM processor. We use the armhf build of ffmpeg for this.

This should link the current armhf static build:
https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-armhf-static.tar.xz

It is possible to get the latest build through command line:
wget https://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-armhf-static.tar.xz

We need to unpack the tar:

tar xvf ffmpeg-git-armhf-static.tar.xz

This provides the binary but we can add it to the path to make it easier to use:
I installed it to /usr/local/bin but there are other locations it could go in $PATH.

It is needed to sudo mv the ffmpeg and ffprobe file /usr/local/binary

An example of this is:
sudo mv ffmpeg-git-20180203-amd64-static/ffmpeg ffmpeg-git-20180203-amd64-static/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/

However the numbers will be different based on the current github build.

You can check the ffmpeg and ffprobe files are located in /usr/local/bin with:

whereis ffmpeg
whereis ffprobe

run:
ffmpeg

to view current version and check installation.
